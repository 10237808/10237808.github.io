			<h1><u>32-bit vs. 64-bit</u></h1>
			
			<p>32-bit and 64-bit are used to refer to the way a CPU handles information. If a computer is 64bit than it can handle large amounts of RAM more effectively than a 32-bit computer. 
</p>
			<p>A 32-bit system can only access 4GB of RAM in total and this is due to the fact that each byte of memory has to have an address and in a 32-bit operating system, an address is 32-bits long (i.e. 2^32 bytes = 4GB).

			<p>As seen in the image above a 64-bit CPU has much wider registers/a higher bit designation, this means that it can hold more data than a 32-bit register and in turn has a higher ceiling of addresses.
</p>
			<h2>Incompatibilities</h2>
			
			<ul>
			<li>A 32-bit CPU cannot utilize more than 4GB of RAM</li>
			<li>32-bit Windows cannot run 64-bit applications</li>
			<li>64-bit Windows cannot be installed through 32-bit Windows, instead a fresh install will be required</li>
			<li>64-bit Windows can run 32-bit and 64-bit applications but not 16â€“bit ones, however 32bit Windows can</li>
			<li>Some 32-bit applications require a 16-bit installer which means it will not work on 64-bit Windows</li>
			</ul>
